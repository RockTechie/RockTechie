- 👋 Hi, I’m @RockTechie (aka Peter) 
- 👀 I’m interested in all things to do with computers, applications, IT in general.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript as well as, Security+, Network+, Linux and a range of other interests outside of IT.
- I'm new to using GitHub Repositories, but have used many different pieces of code to benefit my projects, 
- and I personally thank all those who take the time to create, and share their projects, and expertise to others like myself. Thank You ❤️
